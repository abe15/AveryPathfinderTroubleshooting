The logisto-android-scan app is used in conjuntion with the Avery Dennison® Pathfinder® 6140 Printer to scan the barcode on items with unique ids, query the database for that id, retieve corresponding 'sort' destination, print the label and apply to item.

The files in this repo expanded on the logisto app by adding additional troubleshooting capabilities and adding for configuration settings for 6140 device.
In addition, the main reason for the modification of the logisto app was to create QR codes of barcodes scanned by the 6140 device, which allowed to replace old QR codes that were present in sortation bags.
